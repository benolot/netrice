## Checklist for Pull request

## Naming

- ### File Naming
  - Prefix all scss files with `_`
  - For loaders, their css class name should be the file name, without the `netrice-` prefix
- ### Animation Naming
  - All animations should be prefixed with `netrice-`
- ### Loader Naming
  - All loaders should be prefixed with `netrice-`
  - Aim for a `SHAPE-DESCRIPTOR-MODIFIER` naming system where possible
